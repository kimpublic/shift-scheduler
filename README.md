## Main Features
Users can create and submit weekly schedule plans by dragging on the interface.

A guideline is provided to help users build their weekly plans.

Users may submit schedule approval requests, which will be reviewed by the admin.

The admin can either approve requests or reject them with a reason.

Each schedule request submitted by users is numbered and tracked on the admin side.

## Future Improvements

Improve the admin page by showing the decision result immediately in the Action column, enhancing usability.
